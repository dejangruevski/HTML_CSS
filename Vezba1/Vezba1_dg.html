        <h1>Nature</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Nature</strong>, in the broadest sense, is the physical world or universe. "<em>Nature</em>" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.

        <h2>Earth</h2>

        <p><strong>Earth</strong> is the only planet known to support life, and its natural features are the subject of many fields of scientific research. Within the <em>Solar System</em>, it is third closest to the Sun; it is the largest terrestrial planet and the fifth largest overall. Its most prominent climatic features are its two large polar regions, two relatively narrow temperate zones, and a wide equatorial tropical to subtropical region. Precipitation varies widely with location, from several metres of water per year to less than a millimetre. 71 percent of the Earth's surface is covered by salt-water oceans. The remainder consists of continents and islands, with most of the inhabited <sub>land</sub> in the <sup>Northern</sup> Hemisphere.
